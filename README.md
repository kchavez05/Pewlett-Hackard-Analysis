# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis
This analysis was performed to gain insight into the number of employees at Pewlett Hackard who are ready, or almost ready to retire.  To address this challenge we have provided a list of employees born in 1965 who are eligible for a mentorship program which will allow them to, rather than retiring completely, stay on as mentors for new employees so their experience and knowledge is not completely lost.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
 - The summary of employees who will soon be eligible for retirement by department reveals that there will be significant need for development of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, in addition to other positions.

 - There is some good news, however.  There are a significant number of employees still on staff who will be able to mentor new hires in their respective roles.

  Now, assuming the same size workforce that's about 50 new hires per mentor - which is perhaps more than one individual can manage.  However, it can certainly serve as an important compliment to other training and development practices.

 - Although it makes sense to choose experienced staff for the mentorship program, it may create an age discrimination issue for staff who are experienced and able to mentor, but were not born in 1965.
 - Since the retiring staff is likely to have a higher average salary than new-hires, this may result in a significant labor savings to the company.


## Summary:

 - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72458
 - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? The short answer is no - at least not on a 1:1 basis.
- An assumption may be made that any currently employed Senior staff could be competent to become mentors.  A larger database of those employees would be infromative and would decrease significantly the mentor : new employee ratio.
- A detiled analysis of salaries of retiring individuals vs. salaries of new hires will detail how much labor the company will save.
